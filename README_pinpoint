Solution : 
First, running the binary seems to ask for an address and a value to write to that address.
After dissasembling it in Ghidra, we can notice that the address is 'unsigned long'(%lu), and the value is 'unsigned char'(%hhu)(the 2 h's are ignored). We can also see, in the main function, a check is made on a variable called 'v' such that it's value is 0x53585353, and if that check is true, then a system call is made to execute /bin/sh. We check the security attributes of the binary and PIE is not enabled, meaning that variable will have the same address every time we run the binary.
So, we will have to overwrite the byte located at v's address + 2, i.e. 0x60105A, which is 6295642 with the value 0x58, which is 88 in decimal.
Using netcat to connect to the server, with `nc -nv 141.85.224.99 31337` and putting 6295642 as an address and 88 as a value, we get a shell. Navigating to /home/ctf, we see a file called flag, and using cat on it we get the flag.
