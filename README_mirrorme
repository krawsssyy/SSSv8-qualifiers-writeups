Solution : 
Running the binary, we notice that it asks us for two numbers and performs a check on them.Disassembling the binary with Ghidra, we notice that the check is that the product of the two numbers we've inputted is equal to a number that is the return value of a function called 'max_mirror()'. Upon first inspection, we notice another function being called over there, a function called 'check_cond()'. We check the 'check_cond()' function and one can quickly realize that the function is actually a check if the number is a palindrome. We then rewrite the two functions 'check_cond()' and 'max_mirror()' and put them in a C file, compile it and run the get the maximum value of 906609. Using a simple python script, we get all the divisors of that number, and pick any two such that their product is 906609(I've chosen 913 and 993).
We then connect to the server using netcat by `nc -nv 141.85.224.99 31338` and input the two number, after which we get a shell. We then navigate to /home/ctf/ and cat out the flag file and get the flag.
