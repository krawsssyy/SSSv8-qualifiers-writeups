Solution : 
The second part of the flag was given as we entered the website. Looking through the web page's source, we notice a weird script to create a file called hidden.js along with a version number generated by some date logic. Looking into that js file, we notice the third part of the flag as a comment. Looking even more at the page's source,we can see an invisible <p> tag with an image. Upon further analysis, that image contains the fourth part of the flag. Moving to the network analysis, we see some requests made. Analyzing them revealed nothing, but analyzing the response for the GET request made for the main.css file, we get the first part of the flag. Putting everything back together, we get the flag FFF_PGS{rirel_svyr_unf_srryvatf}, which seems like rotated text. Inspecting it more, it's ROT 13, and doing it again, we get the flag.
